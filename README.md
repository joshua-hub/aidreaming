This will pull down the Fooocus github repository, download models, slightly modify the repo and build a docker container.

TODO: 

Cleanup pipline: 

1. Download All neccessary Files 
    - yaml spec could be handy here 

2. Apply Patches to use local repositories
    - Changes to config 
    - Overlays to support different Models 

3. Updates to the Deployment yaml and Dockerfile

3. Testing without Internet
